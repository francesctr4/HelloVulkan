## Project Description

This project consists on integrating Vulkan in a Visual Studio application from scratch, following the tutorial mentioned below. 
The program has the functionality required for a well-behaved Vulkan application. It is intended to serve as an starting point 
for bigger projects, further improvements or more complex features.

The application has a built-in Demo Scene, in order to visualize the results of the Vulkan Integration in practise.

> #### [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) by Alexander Overvoorde (April 2023).
> #### It is _required_ to download the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) to compile the solution.
